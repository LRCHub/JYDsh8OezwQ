[00:18.84] Everything seems like a city of dreams
[00:22.20] I never know why
[00:23.99] But I still miss you
[00:33.99] 
[00:33.72] There she's standing in a field of lights
[00:37.18] I close my eyes
[00:39.05] But I still miss you
[00:49.05] 
[00:48.62] Woah, woah-oh
[00:53.91] I still miss you
[01:01.91] 
[01:03.02] Woah, woah-oh
[01:09.29] I still miss you
[01:17.29] 
[02:03.87] Everything seems like a city of dreams
[02:07.15] I never know why
[02:09.04] But I still miss you
[02:19.04] 
[02:18.72] There she's standing in a field of lights
[02:22.35] I close my eyes
[02:24.10] But I still miss you
[02:34.10] 
[02:32.99] Woah, woah-oh
[02:39.16] But I still miss you
[02:49.16] 
[02:48.08] Woah, woah-oh
[02:54.04] But I still miss you
