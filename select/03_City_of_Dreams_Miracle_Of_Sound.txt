Wake up!!
Fire up
Nodes in the network
Lights on, electric eyes
Starstruck
Crawling in the dead dirt
Spread a word to the wise
Something is a' coming
Something is a' coming
Silver is the grip on the helping hand
Keep the song a runnin'
Keep the song a runnin'
Bullet to the heart of the brand
Feed the fire
Set me free
In this city of dreams
Push my mind into overload
Hack the wire
Smash the gene
In this city of dreams
We'll be immortal in the code
Mind into overload
Lights flash
Taking your breath away
Black spires, neon nights
Car crash
Freedom in the disarray
Are you ready to fight?
Something is a' coming
Something is a' coming
Silver is the grip on the fretting hand
Keep the song a runnin'
Keep the song a runnin'
Bullet to the heart of the band
Feed the fire
Set me free
In this city of dreams
Push my mind into overload
Hack the wire
Smash the gene
In this city of dreams
We'll be immortal in the code
Mind into overload
Get up, get out
In the city of dreams
Get up, get out
Now we're setting you free
Get up, get out
The voice will never die
Feet upon the ledge
Running out on the edge
Ghosts in the city of dreams
Feed the fire!
Get loose!
Feed the fire
Set me free
In this city of dreams
Push my mind into overload
Hack the wire
Smash the gene
In this city of dreams
We'll be immortal in the code
Mind into overload
Get up, get out
In the city of dreams
Get up, get out
Now we're setting you free
Get up, get out
The voice will never die
Get up, get out
In the city of dreams
Get up, get out
Now we're setting you free
Get up, get out
And shatter the lie
Set me free!
My hands shaking
My mind's breaking
It's breathtaking!
