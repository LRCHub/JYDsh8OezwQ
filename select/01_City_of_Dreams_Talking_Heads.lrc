[00:20.87] Near where you are standing, the dinosaurs did a dance
[00:30.86] The Indians told a story how it has come to pass
[00:41.67] The Indians had a legend, the Spaniards lived for gold
[00:50.76] White men came and killed them, but they haven't really gone
[01:20.76] 
[01:00.72] We live in the city of dreams
[01:11.51] We drive on this highway of fire
[01:20.65] Should we awake to find it gone
[01:25.14] Remember this, our favorite town
[01:41.14] 
[01:50.58] From Germany and Europe and southern U.S.A.
[02:00.45] They made this little town here that we live in to this day
[02:10.49] The children of the white man saw Indians on TV
[02:20.32] And heard about the legend, how their city was a dream
[02:47.32] 
[02:30.38] We live in the city of dreams
[02:40.23] We drive on this highway of fire
[02:49.38] Should we awake and find it gone
[02:54.75] Remember this, our favorite town
[03:10.75] 
[03:19.13] The Civil War is over, and World War I and II
[03:29.17] If we can live together, the dream, it might come true
[03:39.17] Underneath the concrete, the dream is still alive
[03:48.15] A hundred million lifetimes, a world that never dies
[04:14.15] 
[03:58.16] We live in the city of dreams
[04:08.06] We drive on this highway of fire
[04:17.15] Should we awake and find it gone
[04:22.56] Remember this, our favorite town
[04:27.92] We live in the city of dreams
[04:37.09] We drive on this highway of fire
[04:46.33] Should we awake and find it gone
[04:51.75] Remember this, our favorite town
